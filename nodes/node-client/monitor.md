# Supervision tool

## prometheus

Tendermint also supports the use of prometheus metrics. This function is
enabled by setting `prometheus=true` in `config/config.toml`. Through
setting `prometheus_listen_addr`, the default supervision address
`:26660` is changed. The default status is set as enable on oktc's
testnet.

## Supervision tool

Create `monitor.yml`

``` {.yaml}
version: '2'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    container_name: prometheus
    hostname: prometheus
    user: "root"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus_config.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    container_name: grafana
    hostname: grafana
    user: "root"
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

Create `prometheus_config.yml` in the same directory

``` {.yaml}
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:26660']
        labels:
          instance: fullnode
```

Enable `prometheus` and `grafana` in the same directory

``` {.shell}
docker-compose -f monitor.yml up -d
```

After enabling the above, you can see the information on prometheus via
[http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/). You can configure a
dashboard (template id: 7044) suitable for oktc via
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)(the default account name
and password are both admin) and adjust it by customizing the names of
metrics.

Note: Users can also enable `prometheus` and `grafana` through other
methods.
