## Get OKT

OKT is the native token of OKC, which is similar to Ether in Ethereum. To interact with OKC, OKT payments act as gas fees.


On the OKC chain, OKTs function as native tokens. This means that a user can pay gas with OKT as well as send OKT to other accounts the same way they use ETH to pay gas fees on Ethereum and send ETH to others.

> **OKT can be purchased from**: [OKT-USDT](https://www.okx.com/cn/trade-spot/okt-usdt)
