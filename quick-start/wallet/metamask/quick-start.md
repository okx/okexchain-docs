## Get OKT

OKT is the native token of OKTC, which is similar to Ether in Ethereum. To interact with OKTC, OKT payments act as gas fees.

On the OKTC chain, OKTs function as native tokens. This means that a user can pay gas with OKT as well as send OKT to other accounts the same way they use ETH to pay gas fees on Ethereum and send ETH to others.
