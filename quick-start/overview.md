# Introduction to OKX Chain (OKC)
![Welcome to the OKC](../img/okc2022poster.png)

## What is OKC？

OKC is the world's first trading chain — blockchain technology built for trading. It is the next step in the development of decentralized trading, where people can trade anything of value on-chain, and own and control the assets that they trade.

OKC provides safe and efficient infrastructure for creating decentralized applications for seamless on-chain trading of all kinds of assets within a cross-chain, value-exchange ecosystem.

In developing this open-source, trading-focused blockchain technology, OKX has focused on providing lower operational costs for blockchain developers looking to build new decentralized-trading applications. This means lower fees for end-users of DApps based on OKC. We also designed OKC to level up user-experience standards for decentralized trading — OKC's base layer is optimized to provide the best trading performance and experience

## What is Blockchain middleware？
Normally in blockchain industry, developers are categorized as follows： 

* The first one is the public chain developer, responsible for development on underlying technology. Public chain development is featured on a long R&D cycle and high entry barrier.

* The second one is the infrastructure developer, responsible for  infrastructure development, such as wallet, blockchain explorer, exchange, etc.

* The third one is the app developer, responsible for application development, such as DeFi App in 2020. These kinds of developers have higher requirements on technical and operational innovation.

As the development of the Internet, public chains would undertake more complex business with the maturity of blockchain technology. Therefore, decentralized business will require an in-depth development environment. OKC is just designed for these developers.

In the Internet app, middleware is the software building the bridge between system software and application software.Middleware enables applications to share information and resources between different technical architectures,such as process scheduling, message queue, data storage, transaction processing, etc., and it is widely used in energy, telecommunications, finance, banking, medical care, education and other industry software, reducing the software development cost.

Based on that, OKC proposes the concept of "blockchain middleware" to reduce the development cost for application developers.


## The OKT

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the unique ability to contribute to the security and governance of the OKC. Delegate your OKT to one or more of the 100 validators on the OKC blockchain to earn more OKT through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the future of the OKC through on-chain governance proposals.


It is required to stake at least 10,000 OKT in order to apply to become a validator. Besides, a certain amount of OKT need to be deposited to submit a chain-governance proposal or execute an order pending operation.


OKT holders obtain voting rights by staking their tokens. One address can vote for up to 30 different validator candidates, and the number of votes for each validator candidate that the address has supported is equivalent to the amount of OKT the address has staked (1 OKT = 1 vote).

## OKC Explorer

The OKC block explorer allows you to search, view and analyze OKC data—like blocks, transactions, validators as well as other key information.

## OKC CLI

`exchaincli` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with the OKC. `exchaincli` is the only tool that supports 100% of the OKC features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and governance. Learn more about exchaincli with the [delegator's CLI guide](/dev/core-concepts/delegator/delegators-guide-cli.html).

## Running a full-node on the OKC Testnet

In order to run a full-node on the OKC testnet, you must first [install `exchaind`](/dev/quick-start/install-okc.html). Then, follow [the guide](/dev/quick-start/install-okc.html).

If you would like to run a validator node, follow the [validator setup guide](/dev/core-concepts/validator/validators-guide-cli.html).
