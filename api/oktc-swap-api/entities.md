# Entities
Entities define the schema of the subgraph, and represent the data that can be queried. Within each entity are sets of fields that store useful information related to the entity. Below is a list of the available entities within the Subgraph, and descriptions for the available fields.  

## Swap Factory
The Swap Factory entity is responsible for storing aggregate information across all Swap pairs. It can be used to view stats about total liquidity, volume, amount of pairs and more. There is only one Swap Factory entity in the subgraph.

## Transaction  
Transaction entities are created for each OKT Chain transaction that contains an interaction within Swap contracts. This subgraph tracks Mint, Burn, and Swap events on the Swap core contracts. Each transaction contains 3 arrays, and at least one of these arrays has a length of 1.

## Mint
Mint entities are created for every emitted Mint event on the Swap core contracts. The Mint entity stores key data about the event like token amounts, who sent the transaction, who received the liquidity, and more. This entity can be used to track liquidity provisions on pairs.

## Burn 
Burn entities are created for every emitted Burn event on the Uniswap core contracts. The Burn entity stores key data about the event like token amounts, who burned LP tokens, who received tokens, and more. This entity can be used to track liquidity removals on pairs.
