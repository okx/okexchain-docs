# Wasm smart contract
## What is wasm smart contract?

Wasm smart contracts are smart contracts that operated on wasm virtual machine. Wasm virtual machine is more advanced than EVM, these are its main advantages:

1. Faster speed, lower gas consumption
2. Supports more complex contracts
3. Supports Rust, Go, C/C++ and other popular programming languages for developing contracts
4. Cosmos IBC Can seamlessly connect with Cosmos IBC

> Currently speaking, Rust is the main programming language used for developing wasm contracts

## Advanced tutorials for further learning
Smart contract aims to clarify the semantics of how a CosmWasm contract interacts with its environment and data structure of a CosmWasm contract. Learn demonstrates developing smart contracts from zero to production with step by step explanations, code snippets, scripts and more.
- [Dev Academy](https://github.com/CosmWasm/docs/blob/archive/dev-academy/intro.md) provides structured learning content starting from basics of blockchains and smart contracts to Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm smart contracts and clients.
- [Tutorials](https://github.com/CosmWasm/docs/blob/archive/tutorials/hijack-escrow/intro.md) demonstrates developing smart contracts from zero to production with step by step explanations, code snippets, scripts, and more.
- [Workshops](https://github.com/CosmWasm/docs/blob/archive/tutorials/videos-workshops.md) has a great collection of demonstrations and verbal explanations of CosmWasm tech stack recorded in various events and organizations.
