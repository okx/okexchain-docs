# Pin codes
The underlying principle of pin operation is to load wasm code into memory. The validator can pin the specified wasm code through the proposal and the specified code ID. Subsequent contract initialization and contract invocation based on the wasm code will significantly reduce gas consumption and achieve faster execution speed. Unpin is the inverse operation of pin.
