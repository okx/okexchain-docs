## What is OKT Chain？

### About OKX Chain

OKTChain (OKTC) is an EVM-compatible L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability (IBC) and maximal performance. OKTC lets developers build cross-chain applications that can scale with low gas fees. The OKTChain ecosystem and infrastructure, including the all-in-one multi-chain Web3 interface, enables a seamless experience for both developers and users.

### Advantages of OKTChain

- High Scalability & Performance: Based on enhanced Tendermint and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus, OKTC supports up to 5000 Transactions per Second (TPS), letting Web3 applications reach their full potential at extremely low cost.
- Enhanced Interoperability: OKTChain supports Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)protocol that — together with instant finality of Tendermint consensus — allows real time value transmission between EVM chains and the Cosmos ecosystem. Being fully EVM compatible, OKTC allows developers to build projects using standard Solidity developer tooling and deployment workflows.
- Developer Friendly: OKTChain is completely open-source. Anyone can read it, check the progress, comment on it, and help build the ecosystem. OKTChain also provides a native oracle protocol and Chainlink interop for maximum flexibility to access price feeds.
- Secure: The OKTChain team offers a reliable smart contract auditing service, making it a genuinely decentralized protocol that avoids the centralization risks of most blockchain networks today.

## OKT Tokens

## The OKT

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the unique ability to contribute to the security and governance of the OKTC. Delegate your OKT to one or more of the 30 validators on the OKTC blockchain to earn more OKT through Delegated Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the future of OKT Chain through on-chain governance proposals.
Learn more about [being a delegator](/dev/core-concepts/delegator/delegators-faq.html).

## OKTC Explorer

The OKTC block explorer allows you to search, view and analyze OKTC data—like blocks, transactions, validators as well as other key information.

## OKTC CLI


`exchaincli` is a command-line interface to interact with OKTChain. `exchaincli` is the only tool that supports 100% of the OKTC features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and governance. Learn more about exchaincli with the [delegator's CLI guide](/dev/core-concepts/delegator/delegators-guide-cli.html).

## Running a full-node on the OKTC Testnet

In order to run a full-node on the OKTC testnet, you must first [install `exchaind`](/dev/getting-start/install-oktc.html). Then, follow [the guide](/dev/getting-start/install-oktc.html).

If you would like to run a validator node, follow the [validator setup guide](/dev/validators/validators-guide-cli.html).

## Contributing to this Documentation

As an open source project we appreciate contributions from our community. If you see any errors or ways to improve these docs please open an issue or Pull Request.

This documentation can be run locally using `vuepress`:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create and navigate into a new directory in your local dev environment:  `mkdir oktc-docs`
3. Install vuepress globally: `npm install -g vuepress`
4. Create a new vuepress project setup using node v16: `npm init && npm install vue-template-compiler`
5. Clone your fork into the directory and rename it `dev`: `gh repo clone your-github-name/okexchain-docs && mv okexchain-docs dev`
6. Create a .vuepress dir and config.js in the top level directory: `mkdir .vuepress && touch .vuepress/config.js`

The contents of `config.js` will be:

```javascript
const oktcDocs = require('./oktc-docs');

module.exports = {
  title: 'OKTC Documentation',
  description: 'A documentation site for OKTC',
  themeConfig: {
    sidebar: oktcDocs
  }
};
```

You can then run the project on localhost:8080 with the `vuepress dev` command. The formatting and stylings will be slightly different in standard vuepress but the content will be identical.
