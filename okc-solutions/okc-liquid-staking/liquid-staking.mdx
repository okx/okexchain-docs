# Tutorial on Liquid Staking OKT

**OKC's Liquid Staking protocol of OKT is now live!**

Liquid Staking allows users to access and deploy their staked assets, namely OKT. 

Users can now swap OKT for **stOKT** (staked OKT) and earn staking rewards while putting **stOKT** to use just like one would with OKT.

#### Staking your crypto assets would usually come with
 - <1> A high minimum number of tokens required to qualify for staking rewards, and
 - <2> A lock-up period, making your assets illiquid. 

Liquid staking solves both of these issues as no minimum number of tokens is required, and it also allows users to deploy their staked tokens on other protocols.



<Tip title="Tips">
Currently, while staking your crypto assets, users require a particular account of tokens to stake;

These tokens are locked for a certain time and hence, illiquid. Liquid staking solves the problems of liquidity loss and inefficiency of asset utilization. 

**stOKT** allows OKT holders to maximize the utility of OKT by providing access to DeFi protocols while allowing holders to earn the same staking rewards simultaneously.

## How do you liquid stake on OKC?

You may access the `Liquid Staking protocol` to stake any number of OKT tokens on the protocol. 

When OKT tokens are staked, you will receive a corresponding number of **stOKT** (staked OKT) tokens.  


## What is **stOKT**?

**stOKT** is a `KIP20` token representing staked OKT.

 Any staking rewards accumulated will be compounded automatically in the value of **stOKT**. 
 
 As it represents the initial number of OKTs staked, the number of **stOKT**s one would have received does not change over time, even with the accumulation of staking rewards. 

The value of **stOKT**, however, changes over time, consisting of the accumulated rewards and initial staked OKTs. 

A user will then be able to claim the initial staked OKT and compounded staking rewards by unstaking and claiming OKT through the protocol. 

This also means that over time, the value of 1 **stOKT** will not be equivalent to 1 OKT. 

In short, holding 1 **stOKT** is a representation of a share of the total staked and staking rewards pool of OKT.

### What can you do with **stOKT**?
---
 - <1> Earn OKT staking rewards

 - <2> Earn swap fees by providing liquidity to [OKC Swap](/okc/swap/trade) (eg. OKT-**stOKT** pool)

 - <3> **stOKT** will be supported by a variety of DeFi applications on OKC.


### How does it work?

 - <1> On Liquid Staking Protocol, stake OKT to receive **stOKT** in your wallet. Your staked OKT will be delegated to validators for staking rewards that will be automatically accumulated and compounded in the staking pool.
 - <2> On OKC Swap, provide liquidity to **stOKT** pools such as OKT-**stOKT**, and receive swap fees and an LP token that represents your liquidity pool share in deployed pools.
 - <3> When you want to withdraw your staking rewards and its initial staked OKTs, you may return to the Liquid Staking Protocol to unstake and claim your OKT.


## How to liquid stake OKT
 - <1> Go to the OKC Liquid Staking protocol page: [Here](/okc/liquid-staking/stake)
 - <2> Connect your wallet and make sure you switch to the OKC network.
 - <3> Enter the amount of OKT tokens you want to stake, click the `Stake` button, and confirm the transaction in the wallet.
 - <4> The OKC Liquid Staking protocol will send you the corresponding amount of **stOKT** based on the latest exchange ratio between OKT and **stOKT**.


## How to unstake
 - <1> Go to the OKC Liquid Staking protocol page: [Here](/okc/liquid-staking/unstake)
 - <2> Connect your wallet and make sure you switch to the OKC network.
 - <3> Enter the amount of **stOKT** tokens you want to unstake, click the [Unstake] button, and confirm the transaction in your wallet. 
 - <4> The OKC Liquid Staking protocol will burn the **stOKT** tokens once you redeem them and issue an NFT([OKCLST](https://www.oklink.com/en/okc/address/0x07CB2ce543bF5204DAaF1e62c183BBD08752609E)) as a receipt for OKT tokens.
 - <5> You need to hold the NFT receipt and wait for 14-28 days to then claim your OKTs. 



## How to claim OKT
 - <1> After the waiting period, head to the OKC Liquid Staking protocol page: [Here](/okc/liquid-staking/claim)
 - <2> Connect your wallet and make sure you switch to the OKC network.
 - <3> You could see `Total claimable funds` and `Pending amount` OKT amounts in the `Claim` tab.
 - <4> Click the `Claim All` button, and confirm the transaction in the wallet. 
 - <5> The OKC Liquid Staking protocol will burn the NFT receipt, and you will receive the corresponding amount of OKT tokens.
