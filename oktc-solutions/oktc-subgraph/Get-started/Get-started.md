# Get started

This guide will quickly take you through how to initialize, create, and deploy your subgraph with OKC’s subgraph service.

By deploying the subgraph, you can explore the subgraph GraphQL API by issuing queries and viewing the schema.

OKC Subgraph currently provides the Hosted Service. If you want to deploy a subgraph on it, please send your application to  [subgraph@okx.com](mailto:subgraph@okx.com), and provide the information below:
