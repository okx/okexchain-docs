## What is a subgraph?

A subgraph is a custom API built on blockchain data. Subgraphs are queried using the GraphQL query language and are deployed to a Graph node using the Graph CLI. Once deployed and published, subgraphs are available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

## Are there requirements for subgraph code？

- "@graphprotocol/graph-cli": "^0.20.1"
- "@graphprotocol/graph-ts": "^0.20.1"
- "npm": "^7.20.5"

## What are the restrictions when querying the subgraph?
