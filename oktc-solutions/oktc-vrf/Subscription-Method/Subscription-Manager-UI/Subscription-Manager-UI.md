# Subscription Manager User Interface

Subscription Manager User Interface

The Subscription Manager lets you create a subcription and pre-pay for VRF so you donâ€™t need to provide funding each time your application requests randomness. This guide walks you through the main sections of the UI.

## **My subscription**

Subscription components:

<1> **Status**: Indicates if the subscription is still active or not.

<2> **ID**: The unique subscription identifier. Approved consuming contracts use OKT from this subscription to pay for each randomness request.

<3> **Admin address**: The account address that owns this subscription ID.

<4> **Consumers contracts**: The number of consuming contracts that are approved to make VRF requests using this subscription.

<5> **Successful requests**: The number of successful randomness requests that are already completed.

<6> **Balance(OKT)**: The amount of OKT remaining to be used for requests that use this subscription.

You can cancel your subscription in the user interface. When you cancel your subscription, specify the account address to receive the remaining balance. 

## Consumer contracts

The Consumers section lists the contracts that are allowed to use your subscription to pay for requests.

<1> **Consumer contracts address**: The address of the consuming contract.

<2> **Time added**: The time when the consumer was added to the subscription.

<3> **Successful requests**: The last time a VRF request was fulfilled for the consumer.

<4> **Total spent(OKT)**: The total amount of OKT that has been used by the consuming contract.


You can use this section to **add** or **remove** consumer contracts.

## Pending

<1> **Time**: The time when the pending VRF request was made.

<2> **Consumer contract**: The address of the consuming contract.

<3> **Transaction hash**: The transaction hash of the pending VRF request.

<4> **Status**: A timer that informs you how long a pending VRF request has been waiting.

<5> **Max Cost(OKT)**: The calculated total gas cost in OKT based on the configuration. See [VRF v2 Subscription Limits](../SubScription.md) for details.
