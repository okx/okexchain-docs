Basic concepts
==============

Types of OKC nodes
----------------------

Full node
~~~~~~~~~

A full node is a program that verifies blockchain transactions and blocks. Unlike lightweight nodes that only process block headers and a small number of transactions, it requires more resources to run full nodes, which is a necessary step to become a proposer. In addition, full nodes can also be used to provide stable and low latency blockchain APIs for applications.

Validator
~~~~~~~~~

The role of a validator is to exercise block generation rights and enjoy on-chain governance rights. In a voting session, 21 nodes that have obtained the highest numbers of votes from okt voters are elected as validator in the next cycle.

Types of OKC users
----------------------

Normal user
~~~~~~~~~~~

A normal user is an OKT holder.

Delegator
~~~~~~~~~

OKC relies on a group of proposers to maintain network security. The role of a validation node is to run a full node and participate in consensus through broadcast voting (including ciphertext signed by the senderâ€™s private key). Validation nodes are able to keep track of on-chain data, place new blocks on the blockchain and earn yields to incentivize their operation. Validation nodes can only be elected after successfully connecting to the OKC network.

Proposer
~~~~~~~~

A proposer packs transactions and notifies other validators of verification.

Candidate proposers

Duties of proposers
-------------------

A proposer has two main duties:

-  Able to continuously run the correct version of the software:
   Proposers need to ensure that their servers are always online
   and their private keys are not compromised.
-  Actively participate in the governance: Proposers are required to vote on each proposal.

In addition, proposers will be active members of the community. They should always be in sync with the current state of the ecosystem to easily adapt to any changes.
