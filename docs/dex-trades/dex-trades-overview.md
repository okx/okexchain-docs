# DEX Traders Overview

## Introduction

In OKExDEX, an application built on top of OKC, users who want to exchange tokens are called DEX Traders.

OKExDEX is the first project of the OKC ecosystem, and represents a middleware that can freely issue DEX. With the design concept of “everyone can create DEX”, it provides various basic functions needed to operate a DEX.
