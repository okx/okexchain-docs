## Remix
Set up a Remix OKC Mainnet development environment.    
Remix is an in-browser IDE for Solidity smart contracts. In this guide, we will learn how to deploy a contract to a running OKC Mainnet through Remix and interact with it.   
### 1. Connect OKC account to Remix
Go to [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/). There are some contracts in the File Explorer. Select any of these contracts. In this example, we use `Storage.sol`. On the left-most bar, select the Solidity Compiler and compile the contract.

Next, select the `Deploy and Run` option. Select `injected web3` as the environment. This will open a metamask popup for you to confirm connecting your Metamask to Remix. Hit confirm.

You should see your account show up in the left-hand panel.

### 2. Deploy and Interact
Now that your account is connected, you are able to deploy the contract. Press the Deploy button. A metamask pop-up will appear asking you to confirm. Confirm the transaction   

Once the contract has been successfully deployed, you will see it show up in the Deployed Contracts section in the left-hand side, as well as a green check in the Remix console showing the transaction details.

Now, you are able to interact with the contract through Remix. For Storage.sol, input 1000 and click `store`. This will open a Metamask pop-up asking you to confirm. Confirm the transaction. Then, click `retrieve` to get the number, which should be 1000.
