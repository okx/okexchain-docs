# OKExChain fullnode
### How to Run A Fullnode on OKEXChain
### Fullnodes Functions
- Stores the full blockchain history on disk and can answer the data request from the network.
- Receives and validates the new blocks and transactions.
- Verifies the states of every accounts.
### Supported Platforms
We support running a full node on Mac OS Xand Linux.
### Minimum Requirements
The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node.
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X or Linux.
- 500 GB of free disk space
- 4 cores of CPU and 8 gigabytes of memory (RAM).
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of at least 1 megabyte per second
### Setings
##### Sync Mode
- Fast Sync
The default sync mode. Synchronizes a full node doing a fast synchronization by downloading the entire state database, requesting the headers first, and filling in block bodies and receipts afterward. Once the fast sync reaches the best block of the Binance Smart Chain network, it switches to full sync mode.
- Full Sync
Synchronizes a full node starting at genesis, verifying all blocks and executing all transactions. This mode is a bit slower than the fast sync mode but comes with increased security.
### Steps to Run a Fullnode
1.Build from source code
Make sure that you have installed [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/doc/install) and have added GOPATH to PATH environment variable
```
git clone https://github.com/okex/okexchain
cd okexchain
make geth
```
or you can download the pre-build binaries from [release page](https://github.com/okex/okexchain/branches/stale) or follow the instructions below:
```
# Linux
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/releases/download/v1.0.2/geth_linux
# MacOS
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/releases/download/v1.0.2/geth_mac
```
2.Download the config files
Download `genesis.json` and `config.toml` by:
```
## mainet
wget --no-check-certificate  $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/binance-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\" -f4)
unzip mainnet.zip

## testnet
wget --no-check-certificate  $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/binance-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep testnet |cut -d\" -f4)
unzip testnet.zip
```
3.Write genesis state locally
```
geth --datadir node init genesis.json
```
You could see the following output:
```
INFO [05-19|14:53:17.468] Allocated cache and file handles         database=/Users/huangsuyu/Downloads/bsc/node/geth/chaindata cache=16.00MiB handles=16
INFO [05-19|14:53:17.498] Writing custom genesis block
INFO [05-19|14:53:17.501] Persisted trie from memory database      nodes=21 size=56.84KiB time=357.915µs gcnodes=0 gcsize=0.00B gctime=0s livenodes=1 livesize=-574.00B

INFO [05-19|14:53:17.503] Allocated cache and file handles         database=/Users/huangsuyu/Downloads/bsc/node/geth/lightchaindata cache=16.00MiB handles=16

INFO [05-19|14:53:17.528] Successfully wrote genesis state         database=lightchaindata hash=7d79cc…fb0d1e
```
4.Start your fullnode or a validator node
```
## start a full node
geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node --pprofaddr 0.0.0.0 --metrics --pprof
```
start a validator node
```
## generate the consensus key and input the password
geth account new --datadir ./node
echo {your-password} > password.txt
geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node -unlock {your-validator-address} --password password.txt  --mine --allow-insecure-unlock  --pprofaddr 0.0.0.0 --metrics --pprof
```
5.Monitor node status
you can monitor the log from /node/bsc.log by default.
