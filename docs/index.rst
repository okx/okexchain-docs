   Welcome to the OKC
Introduction
============

What is OKC？
-----------------

OKC is a set of open-source blockchain projects developed by OKX,
aiming to promote the development of large-scale commercial applications
based on blockchain technology. It gives each participating node the
same rights, allowing users to launch a variety of decentralized applications
smoothly, issue their digital assets, create their own digital asset trading
pairs, and trade freely. The utilisation of cross-chain technology principles
is essential to allow those features to be used by anyone. Through the
cross-chain module, the value interconnectivity and user interconnectivity,
interconnectivity of blockchain can be realized simply and efficiently,
so that we can co-construct the ecosystem and the value-added system.

The OKT
-------

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the unique ability to contribute
to the security and governance of the OKC. Delegate your OKT to one
or more of the 100 validators on the OKC blockchain to earn more OKT
through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the
future of the OKC through on-chain governance proposals.

Learn more about `being a
delegator <./delegators/delegators-faq.html>`__.

OKC Explorer
------------------

The OKC block explorer allows you to search, view and analyze OKC
data—like blocks, transactions, validators as well as other key information

-  `OKlink <https://www.oklink.com>`__

OKC CLI
-------------

``exchaincli`` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with
the OKC. ``exchaincli`` is the only tool that supports 100% of the
OKC features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and
governance. Learn more about ``exchaincli`` with the delegator’s CLI
`guide <./delegators/delegators-guide-cli.html>`__.

Running a full-node on the OKC Testnet
--------------------------------------------

In order to run a full-node on the OKC testnet, you must first
