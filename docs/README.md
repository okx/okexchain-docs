# Introduction

## What is OKExChain？

OKExChain is a set of open-source blockchain projects developed by OKEx, aiming to promote the development of large-scale commercial applications based on blockchain technology. It gives each participating node the same rights, allowing users to launch a variety of decentralized applications smoothly, issue their digital assets, create their own digital asset trading pairs, and trade freely. The utilisation of cross-chain technology principles is essential to allow those features to be used by anyone. Through the cross-chain module, the value interconnectivity and user interconnectivity, interconnectivity of blockchain can be realized simply and efficiently, so that we can co-construct the ecosystem and the value-added system.

## The OKT

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the unique ability to contribute to the security and governance of the OKExChain. Delegate your OKT to one or more of the 100 validators on the OKExChain blockchain to earn more OKT through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the future of the OKExChain through on-chain governance proposals.
